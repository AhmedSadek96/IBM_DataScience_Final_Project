## Ahmed Sadek - Battle of the Neighbourhoods.

## Introduction/Business Problem
>Bike sharing is an innovative mode of transportation that allows users to make trips using publicly available bikes. It consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the service area. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and return to any other station in the system, making bike share ideal for short, one-way trips. We will analyze the `2017` data for the Ford GoBike System (Now called **BayWheels** since its acquisition by _**Lyft**_.) We want to know what the most popular stations are so we can improve them and run promotions there. We also want to understand the behavior of our clientele so we can use these insights for future business planning.

## Data
> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the year `2017`. It containts multiple features which we'll explore and analyze to answer some questions we will pose based on the data. You can download the `.csv` file containg the dataset used for this project directly from **[this link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)**.
